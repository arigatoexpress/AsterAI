### Mathematical Formulations

**Optimal Spread (Market Making)**:
```
s = sqrt(2 * σ² * T / A)

where:
σ = volatility
T = holding time
A = adverse selection cost
```

**Kelly Criterion (Position Sizing)**:
```
f = (p - q) / b

where:
p = win probability
q = loss probability (1 - p)
b = payoff ratio (win/loss)
```

**Ruin Probability**:
```
P_ruin = (1 - 2p)^n

where:
p = win rate
n = number of trades
```

## Backtesting Requirements
