Sample Integration Script for Playwright MCP in AsterAI

This script demonstrates how to use the Playwright MCP server to automate
browser interactions for your trading dashboard or data collection tasks.

Prerequisites:
- MCP config set up (mcp.json created)
- Docker running
- MCP client (e.g., Cursor) in Agent mode

Usage:
1. Run this script in an environment where MCP is configured.
2. It will simulate testing your dashboard or scraping a sample site.
