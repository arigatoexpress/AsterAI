## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- **NEVER** commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or encrypted secret management
- Rotate keys regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
- Use least-privilege access for API keys

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- API keys are encrypted using `cryptography` library
- Secrets are stored in `.secrets.json` (encrypted) or environment variables
- No plaintext secrets in code or configuration files

### Network Security
- All API communications use HTTPS/TLS
- WebSocket connections are secured with WSS
- Certificate pinning for critical API endpoints
- Rate limiting implemented for external API calls

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis with Bandit
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with Safety
- Pre-commit hooks for security checks

### Infrastructure Security
- GCP service accounts with minimal required permissions
- VPC security groups and firewall rules
- Network isolation for sensitive components
- Regular security updates for all dependencies

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@aiaster.com](mailto:security@aiaster.com)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Use `python -m venv` for isolated environments
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets
- Use `pre-commit` hooks for security checks
- Regularly update dependencies
- Follow secure coding practices

### For Deployment
- Use encrypted secret management (GCP Secret Manager)
- Enable audit logging
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Regular security assessments
- Keep infrastructure updated

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA where available
- Keep software updated
- Be cautious with API keys
- Report suspicious activity

## Security Tools

### Static Analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Pre-commit**: Git hooks for security checks

### Runtime Security

- **Pydantic**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Logging**: Secure logging without sensitive data

### Infrastructure
- **GCP Secret Manager**: Encrypted secret storage
- **IAM**: Role-based access control
- **VPC**: Network isolation
- **Cloud Armor**: DDoS protection
