# 🎯 Local GPU Training & Confluence Trading System

**Transform $50 → $500K through multi-asset confluence trading on Aster DEX**

This guide covers the complete local training pipeline using your RTX 5070Ti GPU, followed by lightweight cloud deployment (~$50-100/month).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Phase 1: GPU Setup ✅ COMPLETED

Your PyTorch installation with CUDA 12.4 is now working!

```bash
# Verify GPU is working
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
# Should output: CUDA: True
```

### Phase 2: Collect Historical Data

Two data collection options:

#### Option A: General Multi-Asset Data (Recommended)
Collects data for 10+ assets including BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, ASTER

```bash
python scripts/collect_6month_data.py
```

**What it does:**
- Collects 6 months of historical data
- Multiple intervals: 1h, 4h, 1d
- Saves to: `data/historical/aster_dex/`
- Generates data quality report

#### Option B: Aster-Native Assets (Platform-Specific)
Optimized for Aster DEX native assets with multi-source fallback

```bash
python scripts/collect_aster_native_assets.py
```

**What it does:**
- Prioritizes Aster DEX data
- Falls back to Binance → CoinGecko → Synthetic
- Handles new assets with limited history
- Saves to: `data/historical/aster_native/`

**Data Sources Priority:**
1. **Aster DEX** (primary, real platform data)
2. **Binance** (fallback for established pairs)
3. **CoinGecko** (fallback for price history)
4. **Synthetic** (last resort for very new assets)

---

## 🔗 Phase 3: Feature Engineering

### Validate Confluence Features

```bash
python scripts/validate_confluence_features.py
```

**Generated Features:**

1. **Cross-Asset Correlations**
   - BTC-ETH correlation (24h, 7d, 30d windows)
   - Asset vs reference pair correlations
   - Market-wide alignment scores

2. **Volume Confluence**
   - Simultaneous volume spikes
   - Cross-asset volume patterns
   - Confluence scores

3. **Technical Indicator Confluence**
   - RSI alignment (overbought/oversold)
   - MACD crossover confluence
   - Bollinger Band squeeze patterns

4. **Momentum Alignment**
   - Directional alignment across assets
   - Relative momentum strength
   - Trend strength indicators

**Output:**
- Feature visualizations in `data/historical/aster_dex/visualizations/`
- Feature correlation analysis
- Confluence signal heatmaps

---

## 🤖 Phase 4: Model Training

### Option A: General Confluence Model

```bash
python local_training/train_confluence_model.py
```

**Model Architecture:**
- **XGBoost Classifier** (GPU-accelerated)
  - Multi-class: BUY (2), HOLD (1), SELL (0)
  - Confidence scores for each signal
  
- **LSTM Price Predictor**
  - Sequence length: 60 hours
  - Hidden dim: 256
  - 3 layers with dropout 0.2

- **Ensemble Approach**
  - Combines XGBoost (60%) + LSTM (40%)
  - Weighted by historical accuracy

**Training Features:**
- Train/val split: 80/20 (time-based)
- Early stopping on validation loss
- GPU-accelerated training
- Feature importance analysis

**Label Generation:**
- **BUY**: Forward 4h return > 2% AND max drawdown < 1%
- **SELL**: Forward 4h return < -2% OR max drawdown > 1%
- **HOLD**: All other cases

**Output:**
- `models/confluence/xgboost_classifier.json`
- `models/confluence/lstm_predictor.pth`
- `models/confluence/feature_scaler.pkl`
- `models/confluence/ensemble_config.json`

### Option B: Aster-Native Model (Platform-Specific)

```bash
python local_training/train_aster_native_model.py
```

**Key Differences:**
- Optimized for Aster DEX fee structure
- Handles new assets with limited history
- Liquidity-adjusted thresholds
- Lower overfitting risk (shallower trees)
- More conservative return thresholds (3% vs 2%)

**Aster-Specific Features:**
- Liquidity scores (volume-based)
- Estimated spreads
- Price stability metrics
- New asset indicators
- Platform activity trends

**Output:**
- `models/aster_native/xgboost_aster_native.json`
- `models/aster_native/feature_scaler.pkl`
- `models/aster_native/model_config.json`

---

## 📊 Phase 5: Backtesting

```bash
python scripts/backtest_confluence_strategy.py
```

**Backtest Parameters:**
- Initial capital: $50
- Risk per trade: 1% ($0.50)
- Max concurrent positions: 5
- Transaction costs:
  - Maker fee: 0.05%
  - Taker fee: 0.075%
  - Slippage: 0.02%

**Performance Metrics:**
- Total return %
- Sharpe ratio
- Max drawdown
- Win rate
- Profit factor
- Average trade duration

**Output:**
- Equity curve visualization
- Drawdown analysis
- Trade P&L distribution
- Results saved to `data/backtest_results/`

---

## 🎯 Model Comparison

### General Confluence Model
**Best for:** Established assets with good liquidity
- More aggressive thresholds
- Relies on cross-asset correlations
- Better for trending markets

### Aster-Native Model
**Best for:** New/low-liquidity Aster assets
- Conservative thresholds
- Liquidity-adjusted signals
- Better for volatile new listings

### Ensemble Strategy (Recommended)
Use both models together:
- General model for major pairs (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- Aster-native for platform-specific assets
- Cross-validate signals between models

---

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Train Both Models

```bash
# 1. Collect data from both sources
python scripts/collect_6month_data.py
python scripts/collect_aster_native_assets.py

# 2. Validate features
python scripts/validate_confluence_features.py

# 3. Train general model

```bash
# Complete pipeline
python scripts/collect_6month_data.py && \
python local_training/train_confluence_model.py && \

```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Training Parameters

Edit `local_training/train_confluence_model.py`:

```python
# Risk thresholds
self.return_threshold = 0.02  # 2% return required for BUY signal
self.drawdown_threshold = 0.01  # 1% max acceptable drawdown

# Model architecture
self.sequence_length = 60  # LSTM lookback period (hours)
```

### Adjust Backtest Parameters

Edit `scripts/backtest_confluence_strategy.py`:

```python
backtester = ConfluenceBacktester(
    initial_capital=50.0,      # Starting capital
    risk_per_trade=0.01,       # 1% risk per trade
    max_positions=5,           # Max concurrent positions
    maker_fee=0.0005,          # 0.05% maker fee
    taker_fee=0.00075,         # 0.075% taker fee
)
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: CUDA Out of Memory
```python
# Reduce batch size in training script
batch_size = 64  # Instead of 128
```

### Issue: Data Collection Timeout
```python
# Increase timeout in collector
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Add more delay between requests
```

### Issue: Low Backtest Win Rate
- Check data quality (missing values?)
- Adjust return thresholds
- Validate feature importance
- Ensure sufficient training data

### Issue: Model Overfitting
- Use shallower trees (max_depth=5)
- Increase regularization (min_child_weight)
- Use more training data
- Cross-validate on different periods
