# üéØ Current GPU Setup Status

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025 - 2:45 PM

## ‚úÖ What's Complete

### Phase 1: CUDA 12.8 Installation - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **CUDA 12.8** installed at: `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8`
- **Verified:** `nvcc --version` shows release 12.8, V12.8.93
- **Environment variables** set:
  - `CUDA_PATH` = `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8`
  - `CUDA_HOME` = `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8`

### Scripts Created - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
All necessary scripts and documentation have been created:
- `scripts/master_gpu_setup.ps1` - Main orchestrator
- `scripts/install_cuda_12.8.ps1` - CUDA installer
- `scripts/setup_pytorch_build.ps1` - Environment setup
- `scripts/build_pytorch_sm120.ps1` - PyTorch build
- `scripts/verify_gpu_build.py` - GPU verification
- `scripts/test_lstm_gpu.py` - LSTM testing
- `GPU_BUILD_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide
- `QUICK_START_GPU.md` - Quick start guide

## ‚è∏Ô∏è What Was Interrupted

### Phase 2: Environment Setup - INTERRUPTED
The `setup_pytorch_build.ps1` script was running but got interrupted during conda environment creation.

**What was happening:**
- Creating conda environment `pytorch_build`
- Installing Python 3.13 and build dependencies
- The script was at: "Collecting package metadata"

**Status:** Needs to be restarted

## üéØ Next Steps

You have **two options** to continue:

### Option 1: Restart Environment Setup (Recommended)
Run the setup script again - it will detect if the environment exists and ask if you want to recreate it:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_pytorch_build.ps1
```

This will:
1. Check prerequisites (CUDA 12.8, VS 2022, conda)
2. Create `pytorch_build` conda environment
3. Install build dependencies
4. Set environment variables
5. Ask if you want to proceed to PyTorch build

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

### Option 2: Manual Setup (If automated fails)
Create the environment manually:

```powershell
# Create environment
conda create -n pytorch_build python=3.13 -y

# Activate it
conda activate pytorch_build

# Install dependencies
conda install -y numpy mkl-devel ninja
pip install cmake typing_extensions pyyaml setuptools wheel

# Set environment variables
$env:TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST = "12.0"
$env:USE_CUDA = "1"
$env:CUDA_PATH = "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8"
$env:CUDA_HOME = $env:CUDA_PATH
$env:PATH = "$env:CUDA_PATH\bin;$env:PATH"
$env:MAX_JOBS = "8"

# Then proceed to build
.\scripts\build_pytorch_sm120.ps1
```

**Time:** 20-25 minutes

## üìä Overall Progress

| Phase | Status | Time Spent | Time Remaining |
|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| ‚úÖ Phase 1: CUDA 12.8 | **COMPLETE** | 30-45 min | - |
| ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 2: Environment Setup | **INTERRUPTED** | ~5 min | 10-15 min |
| ‚è≥ Phase 3: PyTorch Build | **PENDING** | - | 60-90 min |
| ‚è≥ Phase 4: Verification | **PENDING** | - | 10 min |
| ‚è≥ Phase 5: AI Training | **PENDING** | - | 30-60 min |

**Total Progress:** ~20% complete  
**Estimated Time Remaining:** 2-3 hours

## üîç What's Working

### ‚úÖ System Status
- **GPU:** RTX 5070 Ti detected (16GB VRAM)
- **CUDA 12.8:** Installed and verified
- **Visual Studio 2022:** Installed with C++ tools
- **Conda:** Working
- **Git:** Working
- **Disk Space:** 1.8 TB free (plenty)

### ‚úÖ Other Components
- **Paper trading bot:** Running on CPU (testing Aster DEX)
- **Data collection:** 100 cryptocurrencies collected
- **Baseline strategy:** 60% win rate, tested

## üí° Recommendation

**I recommend Option 1** - restart the environment setup script:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_pytorch_build.ps1
```

**Why?**
1. ‚úÖ Automated - handles everything
2. ‚úÖ Error checking - verifies each step
3. ‚úÖ Resumable - can pick up where it left off
4. ‚úÖ Logging - tracks progress

**The script will:**
- Check if `pytorch_build` environment exists
- Ask if you want to recreate it (say yes)
- Install all dependencies
- Set environment variables
- Offer to proceed to PyTorch build automatically

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Don't worry about the interruption** - conda environment creation is resumable
2. **CUDA 12.8 is still installed** - you won't lose that progress
3. **All scripts are ready** - just need to run them
4. **Estimated time:** 2-3 hours remaining for full GPU setup

## üöÄ Ready to Continue?

Run this command to resume:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_pytorch_build.ps1
```

Or if you prefer manual control, follow Option 2 above.

---

**Everything is still on track!** The interruption was just during environment setup, which is easily restarted. CUDA 12.8 is installed and ready to go! üéØ
