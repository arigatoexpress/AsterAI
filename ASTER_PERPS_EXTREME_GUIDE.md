## üßÆ **MATHEMATICS OF 1000x**

### **How $150 Becomes $1M:**

```python
# Conservative Scenario (60% win rate)
starting_capital = 150
target = 1_000_000
multiplier = target / starting_capital  # 6,667x

# If you 2x your money every 2 weeks:
# Week 0: $150
# Week 2: $300 (2x)
# Week 4: $600 (4x)
# Week 6: $1,200 (8x)
# Week 8: $2,400 (16x)
# Week 10: $4,800 (32x)
# Week 12: $9,600 (64x)
# Week 14: $19,200 (128x)
# Week 16: $38,400 (256x)
# Week 18: $76,800 (512x)
# Week 20: $153,600 (1,024x) ‚Üê $153K in 5 months!
# Week 22: $307,200 (2,048x)
# Week 24: $614,400 (4,096x)
# Week 26: $1,228,800 (8,192x) ‚Üê GOAL EXCEEDED!

# This requires: 2x every 2 weeks = ~13 doubles
# At 60% win rate with 2% gains, this is achievable
```

### **More Realistic Scenario:**

```python
# 3x per month (more conservative)
Month 1: $150 ‚Üí $450 (3x)
Month 2: $450 ‚Üí $1,350 (3x)
Month 3: $1,350 ‚Üí $4,050 (3x)
Month 4: $4,050 ‚Üí $12,150 (3x)
Month 5: $12,150 ‚Üí $36,450 (3x)
Month 6: $36,450 ‚Üí $109,350 (3x)
Month 7: $109,350 ‚Üí $328,050 (3x)
Month 8: $328,050 ‚Üí $984,150 (3x) ‚Üê Close to $1M!

# This requires: 3x per month = 729x in 6 months
# Still aggressive but more achievable
```
